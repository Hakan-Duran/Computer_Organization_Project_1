# Computer_Organization_Project_1
With this project, we made a simple arithmetic logic unit (ALU) system that contains an ALU module and special registers in RF and ARF. This module is further used in [Project 2](https://github.com/mymermer/Computer_Organization_Project_2) to build a CPU system that takes instructions from memory and executes them.
